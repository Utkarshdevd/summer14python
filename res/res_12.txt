  subsidiary of Adani Power Ltd  has proposed to set up 4 660 MW Thermal Power Project on Super Critical Parameters in Dahej Industrial Area of GIDC  near Suva Village in Bharuch District of Gujarat  The project site is outside CRZ area over 337 ha of land allotted by GIDC  at the lower estuary of Narmada at distance of about 500  There are no mangroves in the vicinity of the site  The nearest mangroves are in Aliabet at distance of more than 5 5 km  It is proposed to use Narmada Estuary makeup water for condenser cooling  Consumptive water requirements will be met by appropriately treating the Narmada Estuary water  Cooling tower blow down will be returned to Narmada Estuary  Makeup water would be transported to plant through intake water structure and open channel from Narmada Estuary and outfall will be through buried pipeline  Total makeup water requirement is estimated at 23 375 cu hr  Closed cycle cooling system is proposed with Induced Draft Cooling Towers  The outfall is estimated at 16 650 cu hr  National Institute of Oceanography  NIOhas carried out the Marine EIA study and CRZ area demarcation for the project 

proposes 4x660 MW Thermal Power Project on Super Critical Parameters in Dahej Industrial Area of GIDC  near Suva Village in Bharuch District of Gujarat  The project site is to the north of lower estuary of Narmada and outside CRZ area  Water requirement of 23 375 m3 hr would be drawn from Narmada Estuary through open channel intake and outfall of 16 650 m3 hr will be through buried pipeline  The first option of intake from Open Sea at distance of 16 km was technically not found feasible due to instability of intake well  as this area is very dynamic  Also the intake corridor would pass through populated Dahej Town and the Industrial Areas of Dahej   Dahej SEZ  The second option of Intake Pipeline from an Intake Well at suitable location in Narmada Estuary was also ruled out as Gujarat Maritime Board  GMBhas proposed Navigation Channel in the Narmada Estuary for the Shipbuilding facilities along the coast and the Intake Well and the Pipeline would be an obstruction for navigation  Moreover high rate of scouring near the intake well will cause frequent silting of intake well requiring frequent desilting resulting in disturbance to marine ecosystem  The only option left is Open Channel from suitable depth contour has been found technically feasible as it would not pose any hindrance to navigation  The maintenance dredging will be required once in three years as the sedimentation rate estimated is 11 200 m3 year  This was also accepted by GMB  The proposed Open Channel will be dredged to depth of 3 below Chart Datum with bottom width of 20  The total length of channel will be 979  out of which 886 3 will be in CRZ area

All the mitigation measures submitted in the EIA report shall be prepared in matrix format and the compliance for each mitigation plan shall be submitted to MoEF along with half yearly compliance report to MoEF RO 

Appropriate screens and trash bars shall be put in place at the intake to avoid fish entering into the pipe due to heavy quantity of water drawal by once through water intake system 

Temperature and salinity level shall be monitored regularly by providing on line monitoring system at the appropriate location on the outfall system 

Periodic monitoring of coastal water shall be carried out at outfall location 

No construction work other than those permitted in Coastal Regulation Zone Notification shall be carried out in Coastal Regulation Zone area 

The project proponent shall set up separate environmental management cell for effective implementation of the stipulated environmental safeguards under the supervision of Senior Executive 

The funds earmarked for environment management plan shall be included in the budget and this shall not be diverted for any other purposes

Full support shall be extended to the officers of this Ministry  Regional Office at Bhopal by the project proponent during inspection of the project for monitoring purposes by furnishing full details and action plan including action taken reports in respect of mitigation measures and other environmental protection activities 

A six Monthly monitoring report shall need to be submitted by the project proponents to the Regional Office of this Ministry at Bhopal regarding the implementation of the stipulated conditions 

Ministry of Environment   Forests or any other competent authority may stipulate any additional conditions or modify the existing ones  if necessary in the interest of environment and the same shall be complied with
