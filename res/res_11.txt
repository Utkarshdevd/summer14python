  subsidiary Adani Power Ltd  proposed set 4 x 660 MW Thermal Power Project Super Critical Parameters Dahej Industrial Area GIDC  near Suva Village Bharuch District Gujarat. The project site outside CRZ area 337 ha land allotted GIDC  lower estuary Narmada distance 500 m. There mangroves vicinity site. The nearest mangroves Aliabet distance 5.5 km. It proposed use Narmada Estuary makeup water condenser cooling. Consumptive water requirements met appropriately treating Narmada Estuary water. Cooling tower blow returned Narmada Estuary. Makeup water would transported plant intake water structure open channel Narmada Estuary outfall buried pipeline. Total makeup water requirement estimated 23 375 cu.m hr. Closed cycle cooling system proposed Induced Draft Cooling Towers. The outfall estimated 16 650 cu.m hr. National Institute Oceanography  NIOhas carried Marine EIA study CRZ area demarcation project.

proposes 4x660 MW Thermal Power Project Super Critical Parameters Dahej Industrial Area GIDC  near Suva Village Bharuch District Gujarat. The project site north lower estuary Narmada outside CRZ area. Water requirement 23 375 m3 hr would drawn Narmada Estuary open channel intake outfall 16 650 m3 hr buried pipeline. The first option intake Open Sea distance 16 km technically found feasible due instability intake well  area dynamic. Also intake corridor would pass populated Dahej Town Industrial Areas Dahej   Dahej SEZ. The second option Intake Pipeline Intake Well suitable location Narmada Estuary also ruled Gujarat Maritime Board  GMBhas proposed Navigation Channel Narmada Estuary Shipbuilding facilities along coast Intake Well Pipeline would obstruction navigation. Moreover high rate scouring near intake well cause frequent silting intake well requiring frequent desilting resulting disturbance marine ecosystem. The option left Open Channel suitable depth contour found technically feasible would pose hindrance navigation. The maintenance dredging required three years sedimentation rate estimated 11 200 m3 year. This also accepted GMB. The proposed Open Channel dredged depth 3 m Chart Datum bottom width 20 m. The total length channel 979 m  886.3 m CRZ area.
