The proposal has been appraised as per prescribed procedure in the light of provisions under the EIA Notification, 2006 and its subsequent amendment in 2009 and CRZ Notification, 1991 on the basis of the mandatory documents enclosed with the application viz., the Questionnaire, the additional clarifications furnished in response to the observations of the Expert Appraisal Committee constituted by the competent authority in its meetings held on 23rd – 24th November, 2009 and 27th – 29th January, 2010.

 

2.       It is inter-alia noted that the proposal involves development of Jetty (200 m x 30 m), approach road covering area of 1.0 ha. and intake pipeline and well of 0.12 ha. and outfall pipeline 0.13 ha. for desalination plant and for development of jetty back up area at Kharo Creek near village Akri Moti in Kutch district of Gujarat. An area of 50 has been earmarked for captive jetty facilities i.e. belt conveyor, site packing plant and jetty out of the total 313 ha of land for the project. The optimize size of vessel operating at the proposed jetty would be 3000 DWT.  The total water requirement is about 38 cum/day. The sewage generated is normally taken as 80% of the total water requirement i.e. 31 cum/day.  The total area to be acquired is 1.60 ha. It is further mentioned that though the above referred project area is designated as West Mangrove Forests, the area is devoid of forest mangrove. The total cost of project estimated is Rs. 5.25 Million.

3.       The intake is proposed near the ABG jetty, at the co-ordinates Latitude: 23o 22” 23’.28 N and Longitude: 68o 35” 28’ E. The pump chamber will be connected to the bay by a channel of width 2.0 m and depth of 2.0 m below C.D. The quantum of withdrawal will be 800 m3/hr.  The cross sectional area of the channel will be 4.0 sqm at low water the velocity in the channel would be 0.05 cm/sec. The withdrawal of 800 m3/hr will not have any impact on hydraulic and morphology in the creek. The outfall is located in sea coast (inside creek).  The location of the Outfall will be at co-ordinates: Latitude: 23o 21” 53’ N and Longitude: 68o 33” 34’.  The 5 m. depth contour is available at 300 m. to 400 m. from the shore line.  The distance of 10 m. depth contour is about 2000 m from the shoreline near Sanghi jetty. The availability of higher depth near coast in mixing and dilution with bulk of sea water. This area is thus the most suitable place for discharging the return water from desalination plan.  The outfall discharge quantity is @ 11500 m3/day. The ABG Cement intake is located in the eastern branch of the Kharo creek at about 2.6 km from the junction of the link channel and Kharo creek and the outfall is located in Kharo creek at about 1.4 km towards south of the junction.

 

4.         As per the provisions of the CRZ Notification, 1991, as amended from time to time, as per the approved Coastal Zone Management Plan and information furnished by the applicant and the maps prepared by the Space Application Centre, the proposed site for; development of jetty and approach channel fall in the area categorized as CRZ -I (ii) as well as the area between the HTL and 150 m from the HTL which is categorized as CRZ-III area.
