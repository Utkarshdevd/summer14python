Subject: CRZ Clearance for construction of sea water intake and outfall pipelines for discharge of treated effluent into estuary of river Narmada at Dahej, Taluka Vagra, District Bharuch, Gujarat by M/s Adani Power Dahej Limited -Reg.

***    

This has reference to your application No: Nil dated 29.03.2012 subsequent letter dated 21.05.2012 seeking prior CRZ Clearance for the above project under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, 2011. The proposal has been appraised as per prescribed procedure in the light of provisions under the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2011 on the basis of the mandatory documents enclosed with the application viz., the Questionnaire recommendation of the State Coastal Zone Management Authority, EIA, EMP and the additional clarifications furnished in response to the observations of the Expert Appraisal Committee constituted by the competent authority in its meetings held on 16th – 17th April, 2012 and 4th – 5th June, 2012.

 

2.       It is interalia, noted that the proposal is for construction of sea water intake and outfall pipelines for discharge of treated effluent into estuary of river Narmada at Dahej, Talukka, Vagra, dist. Bharuch. M/s Adani Power Dahej Ltd (APDL), a subsidiary of Adani Power Ltd, has proposed to set up a 4 x 660 MW Thermal Power Project on Super Critical Parameters in Dahej Industrial Area of GIDC, near Suva Village in Bharuch District of Gujarat. The project site is outside CRZ area over 337 ha of land allotted by GIDC, at the lower estuary of Narmada at distance of about 500 m. There are no mangroves in the vicinity of the site. The nearest mangroves are in Aliabet at a distance of more than 5.5 km. It is proposed to use Narmada Estuary makeup water for condenser cooling. Consumptive water requirements will be met by appropriately treating the Narmada Estuary water. Cooling tower blow down will be returned to Narmada Estuary. Makeup water would be transported to plant through intake water structure and open channel from Narmada Estuary and outfall will be through a buried pipeline. Total makeup water requirement is estimated at 23,375 cu.m/hr. Closed cycle cooling system is proposed with Induced Draft Cooling Towers. The outfall is estimated at 16,650 cu.m/hr. National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) has carried out the Marine EIA study and CRZ area demarcation for the project.

 

3.       The proposal for CRZ Clearance is for Seawater Intake facility for 25,000 m3/hr & Outfall facility for 16,650 m3/hr. The Intake is proposed through Open Channel, which will be dredged to a depth of 3 m below Chart Datum with bottom width of 20 m. The total length of channel will be 979 m, out of which 886.3 m will be in CRZ area. The location of intake will be at 21°40’39.5” N, 72°39’26.0” E. For Outfall, one pipe of 1400 mm diameter will be laid 1.5 m below the bed. The total length of pipeline up to HTL will be 1257.6 m. The discharge point location will be 21°40’18.0” N, 72°38’33.0” E. A 240 m long diffuser with 24 ports will be provided to achieve a minimum dilution of 46.2 times. The discharge will be at 2 m below Chart Datum. A capital dredging of 0.8 Mm3 for constructing the channel will be done and the dredged spoil will be used for land filling within plant area and away from the marine environment. The study has predicted insignificant changes in the flow regime of the Narmada Estuary. However, the channel will be silted to the tune of 11,200 m3/year, which will require maintenance dredging once in three years. The expected values for the parameters in the outfall considered are: Temperature- 5°C above maximum ambient water temperature of 30°C of the receiving water body and Salinity- 13 ppt above worst case salinity of 30 ppt of receiving water body. The impacts on marine environment have been predicted to be insignificant. Environment Management Plan has been prepared including development of mangroves over 200 ha. M/s Adani Power Dahej Ltd (APDL) proposes a 4x660 MW Thermal Power Project on Super Critical Parameters in Dahej Industrial Area of GIDC, near Suva Village in Bharuch District of Gujarat. The project site is to the north of lower estuary of Narmada and outside CRZ area. Water requirement of 23,375 m3/hr would be drawn from Narmada Estuary through open channel intake and outfall of 16,650 m3/hr will be through a buried pipeline. The first option of intake from Open Sea at a distance of 16 km was technically not found feasible due to instability of intake well, as this area is very dynamic. Also the intake corridor would pass through populated Dahej Town and the Industrial Areas of Dahej & Dahej SEZ. The second option of Intake Pipeline from an Intake Well at suitable location in Narmada Estuary was also ruled out as Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) has proposed Navigation Channel in the Narmada Estuary for the Shipbuilding facilities along the coast and the Intake Well and the Pipeline would be an obstruction for navigation. Moreover high rate of scouring near the intake well will cause frequent silting of intake well requiring frequent desilting resulting in disturbance to marine ecosystem. The only option left is Open Channel from a suitable depth contour has been found technically feasible as it would not pose any hindrance to navigation. The maintenance dredging will be required once in three years as the sedimentation rate estimated is 11,200 m3/year. This was also accepted by GMB. The proposed Open Channel will be dredged to a depth of 3 m below Chart Datum with bottom width of 20 m. The total length of channel will be 979 m, out of which 886.3 m will be in CRZ area.

 

4.       Gujarat Maritime Board has issued NOC for drawl of water from Narmada Estuary and for intake and outfall facilities, as recommended by NIO. Environment Clearance is granted by the Ministry of Environment of Forest for the Thermal Power Project on 25.10.2011. The Gujarat Coastal Zone Management Authority has recommended the proposal on 27.03.2012. The Gujarat Coastal Zone Management Authority had also considered the different options and recommended the intake through Open Channel.

 

5.       The Expert Appraisal Committee, after due consideration of the relevant documents submitted by the project proponent and additional clarifications furnished in response to its observations, have recommended for the grant of CRZ Clearance for the project.
