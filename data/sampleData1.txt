Sub: 1980 MW (2x330 MW & 2x660 MW) TPP Phase-II at Mundra, District Kutchh, Gujarat by M/s Adani Power Ltd - Environmental Clearance regarding.

 

The undersigned is directed to refer to your communication no. PP/APL/RKG/ENV/07/07 dated 26.12.2007 on the above mentioned subject. Subsequent information furnished vide letters no. PP/APL/ EC.II/18-03/08 dated 18.03.2007 and no. nil dated 27.06.2008 have also been considered.

 

2.       It is noted that the proposal is for expansion of existing 2x330 MW power project by adding 1980 MW (2x330 MW & 2x660 MW) under Phase-II at Mundra, District Kutchh, Gujarat.  The project is exempted from public hearing as the site is located in a notified SEZ for power.  The total land requirement for phase-I and phase-II put together is 254.59 ha and the total land available with the project proponent is 293.88 ha.   The coordinates of the project area are 220 48’ 35” – 220 49’ 51” N latitude and 690 32’ 53” - 690 33’ 51” E longitude.  The total imported coal requirement for both the phases is stated to be 7.80 million TPA (for Ph-II 6.00 MTPA).  Imported coal with sulphur content of 0.30% and ash content of 4.0% will be used as fuel.  Coal will be imported through Mundra Port and from there by a straight through railway track with a provision of return of wagons through parallel track.  The total water requirement for Phase-I and Phase-II put together is 23,500 m3/hr (16,298 m3/hr for Ph-II), which will be met from seawater to be drawn from Kotdi Creek through an open channel as per recommendations of NIO.  The intake water structure and facilities, which were proposed for Phase-I would be sufficient to cater to the need of water for the total power project of Phase-I and Phase-II put together.  It is proposed to release the effluents through a pipeline diffuser of 190 m long having 20 number of ports with 31 cm. diameter each to a distance of 3.5 km into the sea at a depth of 4.5 m CD.  No ecologically sensitive area such as National park, Wildlife Sanctuary etc is reported within 25 Km of the project area.  Total cost of the project will be Rs 7866.00 crores, which includes Rs 340.00 crores for environmental protection measures.
