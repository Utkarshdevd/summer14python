***

 

This has reference to the letter of Director (Environment), Forests & Environment Department, Govt. of Gujarat forwarding your application vide letter No. ENV-10-2008-1113-E, dated 22.01.2009 and your  subsequent letter dated 29.03.2009 and 15.04.2009  seeking prior CRZ Clearance for the above project under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, 1991. The proposal has been appraised as per prescribed procedure in the light of provisions under the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 1991 on the basis of the mandatory documents enclosed with the application viz., the Questionnaire, EMP and the additional clarifications furnished in response to the observations of the Expert Appraisal Committee constituted by the competent authority in its meetings held on 23rd – 24th April 2009.

 

2.       It is interalia, noted that the proposal involves the development of Ship Building/Repairing yard at Village Ratanpar, Taluka /District Bhavnagar, Gujarat. The Latitude and Longitude of the site are 210 39’ 10’’ and Longitude: 72017’45’’. The project site is located along the western coast of Gulf of Khambhath. The project is to be developed in two phases.

 

3.       The Facilities in Phase-I include Steel Stock Yard, Plate Straightening, Blasting and Painting Bay, Prepared Steel Stockyard, Plate / Section Cutting: Panel Fabrication Bays, Unit Erection Areas, Block Construction Area: Paint Cell Block, Pre-outfitting Area, Two Ship Building Dry Berths, Two Ship Repair Bays, Three Dry Berths, Wet Basin (268 mx432m), Depth 9.5 meter, One Marine Rail Carriage and Slipway (410 m long, 20m wide), All required mechanical handling Equipments, other facilities; Central Stores POL, Paint Store Amenity Shop, Pump House, Administrative Block, Fitting Out Shops Generator Room.

 

4.       The Facilities in Phase-II involves Dry Dock (300m x 46m x 13.5m), Panel Fabrication Shop, Unit Erection /Block Construction Area, Controlled Marine Slipway within a wet basin so that there is no restriction of launching or hauling up of vessels, A Dry Dock for construction ships of Handymax and also to undertake ship repairs of all sizes up to Aframax class.

 

5.       No Capital dredging is anticipated in the proposed shipyard. The maintenance dredging is anticipated in the wet basin and Dry dock. The maintenance dredging is calculated through the model study conducted by M/s DHI India, by using numerical model MIKE 21 MT with non monsoon sample. The calculated sediment deposition in the wet basin per year would be 16,200 Cum and 3540 cum in the dry dock. Hence the total anticipated maintenance dredging would be 19,740 cum. which would be utilized for the reclamation of low lying areas in the project site. A sewage treatment plant is proposed at site towards NW boundary to treat 88 KLD of sewage/day.  The entire treated sewage will be utilized for green belt, landscape development and irrigation. The other expected effluent in the shipyard is the bilges and waste water from the ship coming for repair. Such waste water would be collected in a temporary holding tank and dispose periodically to the nearest TSDF site.  There is no mangrove plantation in the vicinity of the project site and there is no agriculture land in the project site.

 

6.       The proposed shipyard activity falls in the intertidal area categorised as CRZ I (ii) and partly in CRZ III. The proposed activities need foreshore and waterfront facilities and hence are permissible activity in CRZ area.
