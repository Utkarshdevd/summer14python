Sub:     Coastal Regulation Zone clearance for exploratory/appraisal drilling well in NELP-V Block CB-OSN-2003/1 in Gulf of Khambat, Gujarat by M/s ONGC Limited- Environmental Clearance regarding.

****

 

            Reference is invited to letter No.ENV-10-2007-2274-P, dated 21.8.2008 from Forests and Environment Department, Government of Gujarat, and letters No.WO/BM-I/CB-OSN-2003/1/2007-08, dated 20.4.2007, No.BDA/Basin/HSE/EC/CB-OSN-2003/1/275, dated 26.6.2008, No.ONGC/CHSE/EC/CRZ/2008, dated 27.8.2008 and No.BDA/Basin/HSE/EC/CB-OSN-2003/I, dated 25.9.2008 from M/s Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited regarding the above project.

 

2.         The proposal is for exploratory drilling in offshore block CB-OSN-2003/1 which is located in the Gulf of Khambhat, Gujarat. It covers an area of about 2394 sq km. The area of the study lies between 21o30’N and 22o20’N latitudes and 72o15’E and 72o47’E longitudes and  mostly falls in shallow marine and a little area falls in coastal onland and inter tidal zone. These wells are planned to be drilled from a onland location by an onland rig. Drilling of minimum of 24 exploratory wells out of identified 26 locations will be undertaken. Exploratory drilling is a temporary activity. For onland drilling (150 X 150m) of area will be required, rigs will be used which will be removed after the activity is completed. Site clearance is done for rig erection and drilling activity of a limited area (150mX150m) only for onland drilling. There will be a water storage pit for collection of wastewater, which comes out after drilling operation and the same, is recycled and reused during drilling phase. These storage arrangements will be temporary in nature and will be made at each site for about 45 days, as after the wells are completed, the requirements will cease to exist. Necessary fire fighting arrangements will be made and safety precautions will be taken at the storage site.  The pit is lined with polyethylene propylene sheet. At the end of the drilling phase, the waste drilling fluid is solar dried, filed with soil and capped with compacted murrum layer. The drill cuttings are removed from the mud by the shale shakers and transferred to the mud tank. The mud is cleaned and pumped down the drill again. The drilling mud is about 250m3 and drilling cutting is collected, dried and disposed of safely as per norms. The sewage generated will be treated in a septic tank – soak pit system. The septic tank will conform to the IS design specification. During operation approximately 18-20 persons will be required for manning each shift. The operations will be carried out in two twelve hourly shifts. Light vehicles will be utilized for their to and fro movement from the site.

 

3.         The proposal was considered by Expert Appraisal Committee at its meeting held on 18th and 19th September 2008. Gujarat Pollution Control Board vide their letter No.GPCB/PH/2007-08/Brch-11/17483, dated 24.6.2008 forwarded the proceedings of public hearing carried out on 19.6.2008.
