Sub:     Expansion of Tadkeshwar Opencast Lignite Mine Project (from 1 MTPA to 2.50 MTPA of Lignite and 1 MTPA of Limestone in an ML area of 964.44 ha.) of M/s Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation, located in village Tadkeshwar, Taluk Mandvi, District Surat, Gujarat – Environmental Clearance-reg.

 

Sir,

           

            This is with reference to your application vide letter dated GMDC/ENV/MoEF/261147/08 (A) dated 19.03.2008 for Terms of Reference (TOR), which was granted vide this Ministry’s letter dated 26.08.2008 and with reference to your application for environmental clearance based on the prescribed TOR vide letter No. GMDC/ENV/MNM/359/09 dated 08.12.2009 on the above-mentioned subject and letters dated 19.03.2008, 08.12.2009, 02.02.2010, 16.02.2010, 20.05.2010 and 07.08.2010. The Ministry of environment & Forests has considered the application. It is noted that the project was granted EC on 20.01.2005 for 1 MTPA production capacity. The present proposal is for expansion of production of lignite from 1 MTPA to 2.50 MTPA and for production of limestone at 1 MTPA production capacity in the exiting ML area of 964.44 ha. Of the total 964.4401 ha ML area, 874.90 ha is agricultural land, 73.10 ha is grazing land, (gauchar land), 5.69 ha is surface wate4 bodies, and 11.64 ha is Govt. land. No forestland is involved. There are no ecologically sensitive areas in the 15km buffer zone. RF is found 9.8 km away form the core zone and PF is about 6.2km distance in the North-West direction form the ML boundary. River Tapi flows 5 Km from east to west  and River Kim river is about 6.2 Km distance in the north-west direction from ML boundary. Both rivers ultimately confluence with Arabian Sea. Kakrapar Right Main Canal which adjoins the ML boundary in the east and the Ukai Right Bank Canal coming from the North meets the former near the mine. It is not proposed to modify the natural drainage of the area, except a portion of a nala flowing through the ML.

 

Of the total 964.4401ha ML area, 565.6 ha is quarry area, 97.59 ha is external OB dumps, 2.0 ha is infrastructure., 80 ha is  green belt, and 219.2501 ha is unutilized area. No additional acquisition of land is involved. Ultimate working depth is 94 m. Mining is opencast by mechanised method involving Shovel-dumper combination. Lignite extraction is from two quarry pits namely North Pit and South pit in the initial four years. A garland drain all around and encircling the two quarry pits shall be established to drain the water away from working areas. Entire lignite of 11,364 TPD would be transported by road. No lignite would be stored in stockyard. Water table is in the range of 3.38-8.88 m bgl in the core zone and 3.0-21.86m bgl in the buffer zone during pre-monsoon and in the range of 1.88-6.88m bgl in the core zone and in the range of 1.5-19.86m bgl in the buffer zone during post-monsoon. Peak Water requirement is 439.45 m3/day, of which 58 m3/day will be met from ground water for domestic consumption and the remaining 382 m3/for mining operation will be met from mine sump water. Total OB accumulated is 13.33 Mm3 and an estimated 308.37Mm3 of OB would be generated over the balance life of the mine. Limestone of 1 MTPA capacity would also be generated as part of OB which would be stored in 25 ha of stack area. No R&R is involved. Amount earmarked for Socio-economic welfare measures for the nearby villages (under CSR) is Rs. 1.25 Crores. Capital and recurring annual cost for environmental protection measures earmarked is Rs. 107.70 lakhs and Rs. 113.58 Lakhs. Balance life of the mine is 14 years. Capital Cost of the project is 37.00 Crores.

 

2.         The Ministry of Environment & Forests hereby accords environmental clearance for the above-mentioned expansion of Tadkeshwar Opencast Lignite Mine Project (from 1 MTPA to 2.50 MTPA of Lignite and 1 MTPA of Limestone) within the existing ML area of 964.44 ha of M/s Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation Ltd under Section 7 (ii) the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006 and subsequent amendments thereto and Circulars thereunder subject to the compliance of the terms and conditions mentioned in DFA.
