Sub:     2640 MW (4x660 MW) Imported Coal Based Thermal Power Plant at notified Dahej industrial area near village Suva, in Vagra Taluk, in Bharuch  Distt., in Gujarat - reg.  Environmental Clearance

Sir,     

          The undersigned is directed to refer to your letters dated 08.03.2011 and 04.05.2011 on the subject mentioned above seeking environmental clearance under the provisions of EIA Notification, 2006. The Ministry of Environment & Forests has examined the application. 

 

 2.       It has been noted that the proposal is for setting up of 4x660 MW (2640 MW) Super-Critical Imported Coal Based Thermal Power Plant at notified Dahej industrial area near village Suva, in Vagra Taluk, in Bharuch  Distt., in Gujarat. Land requirement will be 842.50 acres which is in notified industrial area. The co-ordinates of the site are at Latitude 21041’06.57” N to 21042’16.28”N and Longitude 72038’20.38” E to 72039’44.35”E. Imported Coal requirement will be 8.61 MTPA at 90% PLF. Imported coal from Indonesia and South Africa will be used. The original proposal was with domestic and imported blended coal of 34% ash content. However as domestic coal linkage is not available, the proponent have chosen to go for 100% imported coal until domestic coal is available and have accordingly applied for environmental clearance based on imported coal. Transportation of imported coal from Dahej Port to power plant site shall be by closed conveyor system. Sulphur content in the imported coal will be 0.4 - 0.5% and Ash content will be 5-15 %.  Ash pond/dyke area will be 145 acres, which exists within the project site. 1.032 MTPA of fly ash and 0.258 MTPA of bottom ash respectively will be generated. Fly ash will be supplied to M/s Lafarge India Pvt. Ltd. and M/s Sanghi Cement Ltd. Stack height will be 275 m. Water requirement will be 204 MCM/annum and will be sourced from the Narmada Estuary through an open channel over a distance of 780 m from project site. Induced cooling system will be adopted. There are no national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, heritage sites, tiger/biosphere reserves etc. within 10 km of the site. Cost of the project will be Rs 14706.00 Crores.

 

3.       The project has been considered in accordance with the provisions of the EIA notification issued by the Ministry of Environment & Forests vide S.O. 1533 (E), dated September 14, 2006.

 

4.       Based on the information submitted by you as at para no.2 above and others and presentation made by you before the Expert Appraisal Committee (Thermal) in the 26th Meeting held during June 6-7, 2011, the Ministry of Environment and Forests hereby accords environmental clearance to the above project under the provisions of ElA notification dated September 14, 2006, subject to the compliance of the following Specific and General conditions:
