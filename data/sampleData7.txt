Sub:     Expansion of Mata no Madh Opencast Lignite Mine Project (from 0.60 MTPA to 2.40 MTPA of Lignite in an ML area of 1752.6156 ha) of M/s Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation, located in village Mata no Madh, Taluk Lakhpat, District Kutchh, Gujarat – Environmental Clearance

Sir,

 

       This is with reference to your application vide letter No. GMDC/ENV/MoEF/261147/08 (C) dated 19.03.2008 for Terms of Reference, which was granted vide MOEF letter dated 12.06.2008 and with reference to your application for environmental clearance based on the prescribed Terms of Reference vide letter No. GMDC/ENV/4171/2010 dated 10.03.2010 on the above-mentioned subject and letters dated 19.03.2008, 10.03.1010 and 07.08.2010. The Ministry of Environment & Forests has considered the application. It is noted that the project was granted EC on 19.11.1999 for 0.6 MTPA production capacity. The present proposal is for expansion of production of lignite from 0.6 MTPA to 2.40 MTPA in an ML area of 1752.6156 ha acquired. No additional land is to be acquired. Of the total ML area, 407.22 ha is agriculture land and 1314.7138 ha is Govt. waste land. No forestland is involved. There are a number of RF found within the 10km buffer zone. Gugariana RF is found about 0.3 Km away from core. Indian Grey Wolf and Chinkara are the reported Schedule-I fauna found in the area. According to letter No. WLP/32/A/1062-25 dated 19.03.2010 of Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Government of Gujarat, the Narayan Sarovar Wildlife Sanctuary is located at a distance of 3.78 km from the ML and a Wildlife Conservation Plan is under implementation at a Capital cost of Rs 73 lakhs and an annual recurring cost of Rs. 34 lakhs. There are no major river passing through the lease and the area has a few small dry seasonal nalas of which one seasonal nallah passes through the lease. However, the drains passing through the ML form the catchment of a drain passing through the Naryan Sarovar WL Sanctuary. The Sanctuary is not in the predominant down wind direction of the mine.

 

Of the total ML area of 1752.18 ha, total lignite bearing area is 648 ha. Of the total ML area, 699.51 ha is quarry area, 82.68 ha is external OB dumps, 1.70 ha is infrastructure, bund/embankment 4 ha, roads is 5 ha, nalas 100 ha, 272.74 ha is unutilized area and peripeheral plantation and 587.0256 ha is area under exploration. Mining is opencast by mechanised method involving Shovel-dumper combination. Lignite extraction would be from two quarry pits namely North Pit and South pit. Lignite occurs at a depth of 13m-60m from surface. Present working depth is 45m from surface. Ultimate working depth is 60m. Entire lignite would be transported by road. Water table is in the range of 5-9m in the study area and confined aquifer is found at 83m bgl in the core zone. Levels of TDS, hardness are found to be high in the groundwater. Peak Water requirement is 450 m3/day, of which 400m3/d will be met from mine sump water and stored rainwater and the balance 50m3/d from Govt. of Gujarat Drinking Water Scheme. Of the total OB generation of 308.05 Mm3 of OB, 17.23 Mm3 of OB has been accumulated in external OB dump of 82.68 ha area and the balance 291.02 Mm3 of OB would be generated over the balance life of the mine, which will be initially stored in the external OB dump and backfilled in an area of 647.83 ha and the balance 51.68 ha converted into a water body of a maximum depth of 10m. No R&R is involved and compensation to land oustees has been completed. Amount earmarked for Socio-economic welfare measures for the nearby villages (under CSR) is Rs. 6 Crores. Balance life of the mine is 13 years. Public Hearing was conducted on 17.11.2009. Revised Mining Plan was approved by Ministry of Coal on 10.02.2010. Capital Cost of the project is 35.00 Crores.

 

2.
