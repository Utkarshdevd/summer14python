Sub:    Surkha (North) Lignite Mine Project (3 MTPA) of M/s Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation Ltd., located in village Surkha, Tehsil Ghogha, District Bhavnagar, Gujarat- Environmental clearance – reg.

Sir,

 

            This has reference to your letter No. GMDC/ENV/15982/06-07 dated 24.07.2006 enclosing your application and your subsequent letters dated 13.10.2006 and 12.01.2007 on the above-mentioned subject. The Ministry of Environment & Forests has considered your application.  It has been noted that the project is for opening a new lignite mine – Surkha (North) Lignite Mine.  The total mine lease is 4690 ha of which 3851.8946 ha is agricultural land, 294.9940 ha is wasteland, 288.1957 ha is grazing land and 254.9157 ha is surface water bodies. There is no forestland falling within the lease area. No township/colony is proposed. There are no National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuary, Biosphere Reserves found in the 10 km buffer zone. Arabian Sea is 5 km from the lease area. Site clearance was granted on 01.11.2004. Three seasonal rivulets flow through the lease area. It is proposed to temporarily reroute the drain which falls under the pit area. The project does not involve R&R. Of the total lease area, area for excavation is 938.48 ha, area for storage of topsoil is 4.60 ha, 321.65 ha is for OB dumps, 1.65 ha is for infrastructure, 1.22 ha is for roads, 28 ha is for natural drain, 60 ha is for greenbelt. Of the balance 2483.88 ha, an area of 1018 ha (Block C) is to be surrendered, 1040.61 ha consists of uneconomical reserves, 264.27 ha is unexplored and 161 ha consists of a Block D, which is non-mineralised. The final area for which M/s GMDC will execute the lease deed would be 3672 ha. Rated capacity of the mine is 3 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of lignite. Mining will be opencast by mechanised method and does not involve drilling and blasting. Project does not involve ancillary operation or mineral processing such as washery. Existing road is adequate. Mineral transportation of about 10000 TPD of lignite is by road. Ultimate working depth of the mine by is 156m below ground level (bgl).. Water table is in the range of 14.30m – 16.70m bgl in the core zone and 2.60 – 4.0m bgl in the buffer zone. Mining will intersect groundwater table. Average water requirement is 310 m3/d for dust suppression (250 m3/d), green belt (50 m3/d), domestic consumption (10 m3/d) and is to be met from mine sump water (300 m3/d) and from dam (10 m3/d).. Groundwater will not be used for the project. Of the estimated 725.40 Mm3 of OB to be generated, an estimated 10% of OB will be dumped in five external OB dumps of a max. height of 30m consisting of 10m each and the balance 90% of OB will be backfilled. Backfilling will begin from the 4th year onwards. An estimated 4.60 Mm3 of topsoil generated will be used for reclamation and greenbelt development and for plantation. Life of mine at the rated capacity of 0.30 MTPA is 25 years. Public Hearing was held on 09.02.2005. NOC was granted by the Gujarat SPCCB. Mining Plan was approved by Ministry of Coal on 17.07.2006. Capital cost of the project is Rs. 13000 lakhs.

 

2.         The Ministry of Environment & Forests hereby accords environmental clearance for the above-mentioned Surkha (North) Lignite Mine Project of M/s Gujarat Mineral Development Corp. Ltd. for production of lignite at 3 MTPA rated capacity involving a lease area of 4690 ha under Section 12 of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006 and subsequent amendments thereto and under Para 2.1.1 of MOEF Circular dated 13.10.2006 subject to the compliance of the terms and conditions mentioned below:
